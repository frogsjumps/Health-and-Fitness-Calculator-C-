## Can Calculate BMI, BF%, RMR, and TDEE

### This program can calculate BMI, Body Fat Percentage, Resting Metabolic Rate, and Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It takes inputs of weight height sex and age from the user to calculate the measurement. using If and else statements, as well as variables and basic math, it can calculate any measurement.

## Features:
1. Allows user to calculate Body Fat
2. Allows user to calculate Body Mass Index
3. Allows uyser to calculate Resting Metabolism Rate
4. Allows user to calculate Total Daily Energy Expenditure
5. Gives credit to websites used, so user can learn more about their preffered for of measurement

## How to run this program
First, copy the code of this program. Then paste the code in Visual Studios Code or IDE that supports C#

## Techniques used to make this program
1. While loop 🔁
2. Boolean variable ✖️
3. variables ❌
4. nesting if and else statement 🪹
5. basic knowledge of operators ➕
6. Interactive Code 🧑‍💻

### This code works by storing the users measurements and using basic operators in C# to calculate the form of measurement they need. It uses a Boolean to loop the code until the user is done calculating, making for efficient calculations and not having to repeat running the program every time. Shows my ability to push basic C# concepts to the limit in creating a decently complex and useful program.
